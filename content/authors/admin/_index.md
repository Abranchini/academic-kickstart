I recently started my PhD at EPFL in the LIONS group led by Prof. Volkan Cevher. Part of my PhD is funded by the iPhD Grant involving Prof. Gregoire Courtine's lab, where I will be responsible for automating the stimulation used ,in spinal cord injury patients , by employing intelligent decision making systems.

Until now, my academic journey was definitly not a straight path. Currently, I am studying properties of graphs and generative models. I am also interested in online decision making, optimal transport, bandits and transfer and continual learning.

My background involves neuroscience, engineering and computer science. I love to understand how things work and see **how deep the rabbit hole is**!
