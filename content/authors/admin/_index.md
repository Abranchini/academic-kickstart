<div style="text-align: justify">
I finished my second year of PhD at EPFL in the Laboratory for Information and Inference Systems led by Prof. Volkan Cevher and .Neurorestore center led by Prof. Grégoire Courtine and Prof. Jocelyne Bloch. My main responsabilities lie in automating the search, regarding the stimulation protocols used in the project of .Neurorestore where we deal with spinal cord injury patients, by employing intelligent decision making systems.

Until now, my academic journey was definitly not a straight path. Currently, I am focusing on Bayesian optimization (BO) and its applications. Nevertheless, I am also interested in understanding theoretical properties of the models we currently use.

My background involves neuroscience, engineering and computer science. I love to understand how things work and see **how deep the rabbit hole is**!
